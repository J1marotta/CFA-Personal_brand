#Personal Branding Challenge

###1. Find someone with a strong personal brand which aligns with your ambitions

While I applaud Peter's Nomad lifestyle, and how he embraced it and in fact improved the options for other people to mirror him.

What he inspires me most about is how is a doo-er; getting to mvp with incredible speed and 'bootstrapping' ideas into businesses.

I've found I've always been a bit slow to motivate myself into new exciting things, my current year doing wimp2warrior really helped me with that, but again because it was such a great experience; it makes me want to do it again, instead of moving on to my new goals.


###2. Analyse what their personal brand is and what that person does to portray that image

Peter is super active on twitter, and has several articles on his website and also is about to publish a book.


###3. Create a plan for how you can improve the way you present yourself, this could involve creating a digital presence via blogging, creating a presentation for a local meetup or writing a list of key qualities and strengths you would want to communicate.

The image I want to present is of a doo-er, one way look like a doo-er is to do.
I need to focus on improving my github and my online presence to represent more actual projects.   Build something


###4. Write a dot point elevator pitch which you could use when talking to people  at meetups. This pitch should communicate how people should perceive you.

I've come from a hospitality background, And found myself reading tech news everyday and I decided it was time to move away from constantly consuming to actually creating.  I have a knack for problem solving and It really annoys me when I find a product with a terrible user experience, or non ergonomic design.



###5. Write a bio to include on your portfolio site
I am Learning to code, I am learning to create!.



###6. Test run your elevator pitch with Jamie :)
